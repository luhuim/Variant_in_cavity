Title: Finding Entity in PDB
Date: 2022 September 27
Author: Huimin Lu
Version: A[auth B], this version write letter inside of squrare bracket

Description:
    
    In the input file, under every PDB ID, there are one or couple of chains. 
    In databese PDB, every PDB_ID has one or couple of entities. 
    This program is to find all entity that correspond to chains in input file. And then add Annotation.
    
    In PDB databse, the chain has many kinds of format, for example: "A[auth B]","A,B" and so on.
    For one line in input file, if it match with an entity both in chain and Uniprot ID, we will add the annotation of this entity in this line in output file
    
    We classify the format of chain into five cases
        A
        A,B,C
        A[auth B]
        A[auth B], C[auth D]
        A[auth B],C,D
    Specially, in case of format "A[auth B]", two letter correspond to one chain. 
    The data in SIFT use chain character inside the square bracket. So if the information in input file match with character inside the square bracket and its Uniprot ID, we will add this annotation in output file. 
    
    In the case of "A,B,C" and "A[auth B],C,D", if couple of chains and theirs Uniprot ID match with this entity, we will only leave the longest chain.
    
List of function:

Procedure:
    1, Read line one by one, add the lines with same PDB_ID in a list called "PDB_list".
    2, When the list "PDB_list" is full, searching PDB webpage to look at entities
    3, For every entity, we use BeautifulSoup to find the Annotation and Chain of this entity,
        and use API to find the Uniprot ID
    4, According to the format of "Chain", we have different process to check 
        whether the input file has corresopnd chain
        The principle framework is:
##############################################################
        if "[" in the chain:
            if len(chain_list)==square_bracket:
                if square_bracket==1:
                    B [auth P]
                else:
                    G [auth M],H [auth N],I [auth O]
            else:
                A,B,E [auth C],F [auth D]
        else:
            if len(chain_list)==1:
                A
            else:
                G, H
###############################################################
    5, If there is one element in "PDB_list" which can correspond with both Chain and Uniprot ID, we will write this line in output file adding Annotation
    6, After finishing final entity of this PDB_ID, empty variable "PDB_list" and start new PDB_ID.

Usage:
    command line:
    python 2022-09-27_Filtering.py sample_data_3.tsv sample_3_result.tsv

Special Note: In the case of "A [auth B]", This script will write "B" in output file.
